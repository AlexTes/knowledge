# Ask LJHarb Anything
List of things that could use a documented answer. Where I've seen a good answer before. Usually given by LJHarb. I added a number for how many times I've seen LJHarb answer the question.
* Should you ship my node_modules with deployments? (1)
* Should you use Babel's ES modules in libraries and / or top-level apps? (2)
* Should you globally install tools you want in your PATH?
* Can you add project local binaries to your PATH automatically?
