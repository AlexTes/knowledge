# Meditation Notes

## Open Questions
* How to maintain mindfulness more often? Mindfulness being a more accurate or wide awareness of sensations and a less-suffering or less-unatural responding to those sensations.
* How to get better at helping others meditate? Now I simply respond with what arises in a moment but sometimes what arises is vague. I.e. How did I get calm, or happy or more free from suffering?
* Should I observe awareness moving around or try to keep it on a single object?
* Am I trying to break into stage three or stage five?
* How does one become a meditation teacher and help others be free from suffering?
