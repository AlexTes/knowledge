# Writing more expressive code
Part 1

## Leslie Lamport, future of computing

## JavaScript
* write strip questionmark
* write parse query string
* try to print the city of the passed user

## TypeScript
* add TypeScript
* fix errors

## PureScript
* split string on char
* discovering edge cases
* expressing what we learned

Part 2
Star diagram, code expressiveness.
* concise (information dense, saying much with little, compound meaning, highly abstract)
* precise (ability to express one thing which is not another thing)
* ??? (one way to say a thing)
* powerful (not-turing compleness, ease with which to enact large state effects)
* clarity?
* readability?

Some language concepts sink like rocks. They are what you build upon. Once the tool is understood, and by understood I mean your understanding has become sub-conscious, it changes very little over time. They have low mental overhead. Think map and reduce. React state and views. Functors and monads.
