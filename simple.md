# Simple
Thoughts on simplicity in software development. Mostly inspired by Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey.

Simple is the converse of complex. Complexity in dev is :[ .

## Easy is not simple (nearness)
Easy does not mean simple. Conversely hard does not equal complex. Easy can be thought of as nearness. How far away is the thing you want to get, lets call this destinational far-ness, or conversely how close are you to the thing you're trying to obtain, origin close-ness. A good example to clarify these concepts with is basic arithmetic. Lets define our knowledge origin as low. Say the knowledge of a 5 or 6 year old. Arithmetic might be very hard to read to a 6 year old but is regardless, very simple to understand. Even the symbolism is simple and that's why it's easy to explain. In other words, basic arithmetic is very near, conceptually no matter what your current knowledge, your origin. The concepts within are simple and immediately obvious. Placing two single apples together makes for a collection of two apples. 1 + 1 = 2.

### Easy is relative
Things can be _near_ because of your familiarity. Your knowledge origin is close to your knowledge destination.

### Easy to obtain. Convenience. (near)

#### Speed

#### Familiarity

### Easy to understand
Simplicity.

## Simplicity

### Cardinality
Few is not automatically simple.

### Simplicity is objective

### Simplicity of understanding vs. obtaining
Simple to understand is not always simple to obtain.
