# Simple
Thoughts on simplicity in software development. Mostly inspired by Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey.

Simple is the converse of complex. Complexity in dev is :[ .

## Easy is not simple
Easy does not mean simple. Conversely hard does not equal complex. A good example is basic algebra. Without primary school arithmetic algebra is very hard to understand. The meaning is not apparent in its symbolism. That said it is easy to learn its meaning because basic arithmetic is simple. The concepts within are simple and immediately obvious. Placing two single apples together makes for a collection of two apples. 1 + 1 = 2.
Something that is easy to obtain is not necessarily simple. Setting up a web project with templating, SSR, transpiling, in-memory caching during development, and hot reloading can literally be set up in seconds. This says absolutely nothing about how simple this project is to work with, only how easy it is to obtain all the above features.
