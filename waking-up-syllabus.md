# Waking Up Syllabus
Description of the content of the meditations in the Waking Up app. This is not a replacement for doing the meditations, or even understanding their contents. The descriptions are here to refresh my memory when conversing about experiences during a specific meditation.

## Day 1
5 minutes of paying attention the breath. Non-judgement of mind wandering. Suggestion to stay with observation. Long conclusion making a beautiful analogy using the night sky and its stars to explain the wisdom of meditation is hard to transfer through words. You have to see for yourself.

## Day 2
Focus on the breath. Try not to control the breath. Great explanation of how your experience happens by the grace of your mind, and yet we don't understand or look at it. Training your mind could be one of the most significant things you do.
